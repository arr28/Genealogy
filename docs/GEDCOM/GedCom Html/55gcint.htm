<H1 align=center>The GEDCOM Standard Release 5.5</H1>
<H2 align=center>Introduction</H2>
<br>
GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized
genealogical data. GEDCOM is an acronym for 
<B> 
<em u> GE</B>
</em>
nealogical 
<B> 
<em u> D</B>

<B> 
<em u> Com</em>
</B>
munication. Its purpose is
to foster the sharing of genealogical information and the development of a wide range of inter-operable software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.
<br>
<br>
<B><a name=S1></a> Purpose and Content of <em i>The GEDCOM Standard</em></B>
<br>
<br>
<em i>The GEDCOM Standard</em> is a technical document written for computer programmers, system
developers, and technically sophisticated users. It covers the following topics:
<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>GEDCOM Data Representation Grammar (see <a href=55gcch1.htm>Chapter 1</a>)
<LI>Lineage-Linked Grammar (see <a href=55gcch2.htm>Chapter 2</a>)
<LI>Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Tags (see <a href=55gcch2.htm>Chapter 2</a> and <a href=55gcappa.htm>Appendix A</a>)
<LI>Cross Reference of Structures and Primitives (see <a href=55gcappb.htm>Appendix B</a>)
<LI>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' temple codes (see <a href=55gcappc.htm>Appendix C</a>)
<LI>ANSEL Character Codes (see <a href=55gcch3.htm>Chapter 3</a>, and <a href=55gcappd.htm>Appendix D</a>)
</UL>
<br>
<br>
This document describes GEDCOM at two different levels. <a href=55gcch1.htm>Chapter 1</a> describes the lower level,
known as the <em i>
<B> GEDCOM data format.</B>
</em> This is a general-purpose data representation language for
representing any kind of structured information in a sequential medium. It discusses the syntax and
identification of structured information in general, but it does not deal with the semantic content of
any particular kind of data. It is, therefore, also useful to people using GEDCOM for storing other
types of data, not just genealogical data.
<br>
<br>
<a href=55gcch2.htm>Chapter 2</a> of this document describes the higher level, known as a <em i>
<B> GEDCOM form.</B>
</em> Each type of
data that uses the GEDCOM data format has a specific GEDCOM form. This document discusses
only one GEDCOM form: the <em i>Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form.</em> This is the form commercial
software developers use to create genealogical software systems that can exchange compiled
information about individuals with accompanying family, source, submitter, and note records with
the Family History Department's FamilySearch Systems and with each other if desired.

<br>
<br>
<B><a name=S2></a> Purposes for Version 5.x</B>
<br>
<br>
Earlier versions of <em i>The GEDCOM Standard</em> were released in October 1987 (3.0) and August 1989
(4.0). Versions 1 and 2 were drafts for public discussion and were not established as a standard.
<br>
<br>
The 5.x series of drafts includes both the first standard definition of the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM
Form and also the first major expansion of the Lineage-Linked Form since its initial use in
GEDCOM 3.0. The GEDCOM-compatible products registered as 4.0 systems should still be able to
exchange all of the data that was previously handled by their product with GEDCOM 5.x systems. See 
<a href=55gcch2.htm#S4>Compatibility with Previous GEDCOM Releases</a> for compatibility
specifics.
<br>
<br>
The following are the expanded purposes of Lineage-Linked GEDCOM :
<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Simplify the description of the GEDCOM data representation grammar (rules) for ease of
understanding. (See <a href=55gcch1.htm>Chapter 1</a>.)
<LI>Standardize the valid contexts in which tags, values, and pointers appear in the Lineage-Linked
GEDCOM Form. (See <a href=55gcch2.htm>Chapter 2</a>.) The Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form
should not be confused with other GEDCOM forms, which apply the basic GEDCOM data
format but use different tag, value, and pointer combinations for other purposes.
<LI>Define new data representations for supporting information such as sources, source citations,
repositories, submitter records, submission records, and notes. (See <a href=55gcch2.htm>Chapter 2</a> for
GEDCOM representation of these support structures as used by the lineage-linked grammar.)
<LI>Define a generic event structure.
<LI>Define a way of associating individuals one to another.  This is accomplished through a pointer
which points from one individual record to another with a user-defined relationship description
placed subordinate to this pointer.  This feature is not a substitute for handling direct family
relationships. Direct family relationships are represented by the FAMC and FAMS pointers.
<LI>Add a product version number and a GEDCOM form and version number to the HEADer
record structure.
<LI>Define DATE modifiers (FROM, TO, ABT, BEF, AFT, BET) and more rigorously define the
regular date format.
<LI>Define an integration of multimedia within GEDCOM.
</UL>
<br>
<br>
<B><a name=S3></a> Modifications in Version 5.5 as a result of the 5.4 (draft) review</B>
<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Added tags for storing detailed address pieces under the address structure.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Added nickname and surname prefix name pieces to the personal name structure.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Added subordinate source citation to the note structure.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Changed the encoding rules and the structure for including embedded multimedia objects.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Added a RIN tag to the record structures.  The RIN tag is a record identification assigned to the
record by the source software.  Its intended use is to allow for automated access to that record
upon receipt of return transactions or other reconciliation processes.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The meaning of a GEDCOM tag without a value on its line depends on its subordinate context
for any assertions intended by the researcher. For example, In an event structure, a subordinate
DATE and/or PLACe value imply that an event happened. However, a subordinate NOTE orSOURce context by themselves do not imply that the event took place. For a researcher to
indicate that an event took place without knowing a date or a place requires that a Y(es) value
be added to the event tag line.  Using this convention protects GEDCOM processors which may
remove (prune) lines that have no value and also no subordinate lines. A N(o) value must not be
used on an event tag line to assert that the event never happened. This requires the definition of
a different tag.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Returned the calendar escape sequence to support alternate calendars.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The definition of the date value was refined to include many of the potential ways in which a
person may define an imprecise date in a free form text field.  Systems which guide users
through a date statement should not result in such a precise way of stating an imprecise date. 
For example, if software was to estimate a marriage date based on an algorithm involving the
birth date of the couple's first child, hardly needs to say "EST ABT 1881".
<br>
<br>
<LI>The following tags were added:
<br>
ADR1, ADR2, CITY, NICK, POST, SPFX
</UL>
<br>
<br>
<B><a name=S4></a> Changes Introduced or Modified in Draft Version 5.4</B>
<br>
<br>
Some changes introduced in GEDCOM draft version 5.4 are not compatible with earlier 5.x draft
forms. Some concepts have been removed with the intent to address them in a future release of
GEDCOM.   The following features are either new or different:
<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>The use of the SCHEMA has been eliminated. Although the schema concept is valid and
essential to the growth of GEDCOM, it is too complex and premature to be implemented
successfully into current products. Implementing it too early could cause developers to spend a
great deal of resources programming something that would be outdated very quickly. Object
definition languages are likely to contribute to meeting these needs.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The EVENT_RECORD context has been deleted. This context was intended to support the
evidence record concept in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form, which ended up being more
complicated than first supposed. Understanding the difference between the role of a source
record and the role of a so-called evidence record requires further study.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Non-standard tags (see &lt;<a href=55gcch2.htm#NEW_TAG>NEW_TAG</a>&gt;) can be used within a GEDCOM transmission,
provided that the first character is an underscore (for example _NUTAG). Non-standard tags
should be used only when structured information cannot be represented using existing context.
Using a Note field is a more universal way of transmitting genealogical data that does not fit
into the standard GEDCOM structure.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The SOURCE_RECORD structure was simplified into five basic sections: data or classification,
author, title, publication facts, and repository. The data or classification section contains facts
about the data represented by this source and is used to analyze the collection of sources that the
researcher used. The author, title, publication facts, and repository sections provide free-form
text blocks that inform subsequent researchers how to access the source data that the original
researcher used.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The &lt;&lt;SOURCE_CITATION&gt;&gt; structure is placed subordinate to the fact being cited. It is
generally best if the source citation contains only information specific to the fact being cited and
then points to the more general description of the source, defined in a SOURCE_RECORD.
This reduces redundancy, provides a way of controlling the GEDCOM record size, and more
closely represents the normalized data model.
<br>
<br>
Systems that represent sources using the AUTHor, TITLe, PUBLication, and REPOsitory
descriptions <em i>can and should always pass this information in GEDCOM using the SOURce record</em>
pointed to by the &lt;&lt;SOURCE_CITATION&gt;&gt;. Systems that do not represent source
information in these categories should provide the following information as unstructured text
using the tags, TITL, AUTH, PUBL, and REPO, respectively, within the text:
<br>
<UL>
  <LI>A descriptive title of the source
<br>
  <LI>Who created the work
<br>
  <LI>When and where was it created
<br>
  <LI>Where can it be obtained or viewed
</UL>
<br>
<br>
<LI>Some attributes of individuals such as their EDUCation, OCCUpation, RESIdence, or nobility
TITLe need to be described using a date and place.  Therefore, the structure to describe the
attributes was formatted to be the same as for describing events. That is, these attributes are
further defined using a date, place, and other values used to describe events. (See
&lt;&lt;<a href=55gcch2.htm#INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE</a>&gt;&gt;.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The LDS ordinance structure was extended to include the place of a living LDS ordinance. The
TYPE tag line was changed to a STATus tag line.  This allows statements such as <em i>BIC,
canceled, Infant,</em> and so forth to be removed from the date line and be added here under the
STATus tag. (See &lt;<a href=55gcch2.htm#LDS_BAPTISM_DATE_STATUS>LDS_<em i>(ordinance)</em>_DATE_STATUS</a>&gt;) where <em i>(ordinance)</em>
represents any of the following:
<a href=55gcch2.htm#LDS_BAPTISM_DATE_STATUS>BAPTISM</a>,
<a href=55gcch2.htm#LDS_ENDOWMENT_DATE_STATUS>ENDOWMENT</a>,
<a href=55gcch2.htm#LDS_CHILD_SEALING_DATE_STATUS>CHILD_SEALING</a>, or
<a href=55gcch2.htm#LDS_SPOUSE_SEALING_DATE_STATUS>SPOUSE_SEALING</a>.
<br>
<br>
<LI>Previous GEDCOM 5.x versions overloaded the FAMC pointer structure with subordinate
events which connected individual events and an associated family.  An adoption event, for
example, was shown subordinate to the FAMC pointer to indicate which was the adoptive
family. The sealing of child to parent event (SLGC) was also shown in this manner.  GEDCOM
5.4 recognizes that these are events and should be at the same level as the other individual
events.  To show the associated family, a subordinate FAMC pointer is placed subordinate to
the appropriate event. (See &lt;&lt;<a href=55gcch2.htm#INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE</a>&gt;&gt; and
<a href=55gcch2.htm#LDS_INDIVIDUAL_ORDINANCE>LDS_INDIVIDUAL_ORDINANCE</a>)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The date modifier (
<B> int</B>
) was added to the date format to indicate that the associated date phrase
has been interpreted and the interpretation follows the 
<B> int</B>
 prefix in the date field.  The date
phrase is also included in the date value enclosed in parentheses. (See
&lt;
<a href=55gcch2.htm#DATE_APPROXIMATED>DATE_APPROXIMATED</a>&gt;.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The &lt;AGE_AT_EVENT&gt; primitive definition now includes the key words <em i>STILLBORN,
INFANT,</em> and <em i>CHILD.</em> These words should be interpreted as being an approximate age at an
event. (See &lt;
<a href=55gcch2.htm#AGE_AT_EVENT>AGE_AT_EVENT</a>&gt;.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The family event context in the FAMily record now allows the ages of both the husband and
wife at the time of the event to be shown. (See
<a href=55gcch2.htm#FAM_RECORD>FAM_RECORD</a>)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The &lt;&lt;PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE&gt;&gt; structure now allows name pieces to be
specifically identified as subordinate parts of the name line. Most products will not use
subordinate name pieces. A nickname can now be included on the name line by enclosing it in
double quotation marks. <em i> Note: </em>Systems using the subordinate name parts must still provide the
name structure formed in the same way specified for &lt;
<a href=55gcch2.htm#NAME_PERSONAL>NAME_PERSONAL</a>&gt;.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>A submission record was added to GEDCOM to enable the sending system to transmit
information which will enable the receiving system to more appropriately process the GEDCOM
data. The format currently designed for the submission record was created specifically for
TempleReady<em sup>%</em> system and for GEDCOM files being downloaded from Ancestral File<em sup>%</em>. (See
<a href=55gcch2.htm#SUBMISSION_RECORD>SUBMISSION_RECORD</a>.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>A RESTRICTION (RESN) tag and a &lt;RESTRICTION_NOTICE&gt; primitive were added to the
INDIVIDUAL_RECORD context. This allows some records in Ancestral File to be marked for
privacy (indicating some personal information is not included) and some records to be marked
as locked (indicating that Ancestral File will not make changes to the record without
authorization from an assigned record steward). 
<br>
<br>
<LI>The following tags are no longer used in the Lineage-Linked Form:
<br>
ARVL, BROT, BUYR, CEME, CNTC, CPLR, DEFM, DPRT, EDTR, FIDE, FILM, GODP,
HDOH, HEIR, HFAT, HMOT, INFT, INDX, INTV, ISA, ISSU, ITEM, LABL, LCCN,
LGTE, MBR, NAMS, NAMR, OFFI, ORIG, OWNR, PERI, PORT, PWIF, PUBR, RECO,
SELR, SEQU, SERS, SIBL, SIGN, SIST, SITE, TXPY, XLTR, WFAT, WITN, WMOT,
AUDIO, IMAGE, PHOTO, SCHEMA, VIDEO
<br>
<br>
<LI>The following tags were added:
<br>
BLOB, CTRY, CREM, FCOM, GIVN, NPFX, NSFX, OBJE, PEDI, RELA, RESI, RESN,
SUBN, SURN, STAT
</UL>
<br>
<br>
<B><a name=S5></a> Changes Introduced in Draft Version 5.3</B>
<br>
<br>
Version 5.3 introduced the following changes to the GEDCOM standard:
<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>An address structure was defined.
<br>
<br>
<LI>A new tag for marital status (MSTA) at the time of an event was added to the event structure.
(This was removed in version 5.4.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>A mechanism for creating user-defined tags was added. These were defined in a SCHEMA
definition in the header record of 5.3. (SCHEMA was removed in version 5.4.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The Unicode standard (ISO 10646) was introduced as an additional character set. (This was
reduced to potential character set in version 5.4. See <a href=55gcch3.htm>Chapter 3</a>.)
<br>
<br>
<LI>A &lt;&lt;MULTIMEDIA_LINK&gt;&gt; structure was introduced to provide linking and embedding
of digitized photo, video, and sound files. (This was modified in version 5.4. See
<a href=55gcch2.htm#MULTIMEDIA_LINK>MULTIMEDIA_LINK</a> and
<a href=55gcch2.htm#MULTIMEDIA_RECORD>MULTIMEDIA_RECORD</a>
)
<br>
<br>
<LI>The source structure NAME tag, meaning the name of the source in the
&lt;&lt;SOURCE_STRUCTURE&gt;&gt;, was changed back to the TITLe tag and is used to show the
title of a book, article, or descriptive title of non-titled sources.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The &lt;&lt;SOURCE_STRUCTURE&gt;&gt; was changed. Usage of CPLR, XLTR, and INFT tags in
source substructures was discontinued.
<br>
<br>
<LI>The FORM {FORMAT} tag was added subordinate to the PLACe and the GEDCom tags in the
HEADER record and also subordinate to the PLACe tag in the
&lt;&lt;PLACE_STRUCTURE&gt;&gt;. The PLAC.FORM line in the header record indicates that all
of the locality names are specified in a consistent hierarchal sequence as specified by the value
of the FORM. For example: 2 FORM City, County, State. GEDCOM 5.2 used the TYPE tag,
subordinate to the PLAC tag instead of the FORM tag, for this purpose. This provision is for
products which have overly structured the place value.
